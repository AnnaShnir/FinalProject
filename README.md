July 4th party planner!

This app will allow users to sign in with their gmail account and see a list of local happenings involving GA students and their connections.
The app will show the list of parties planned to celebrate America's birthday. Once signed in, a user will be able to create a party, adding it's location, description, and marking the supplies needed. 
Alternatively, a user can organie a party, selecting its main type of activity, adding location and inviting people. This will create a Google Calendar event. All people who are invited or who sign up to go to this party will be notified via gmail nd the event will be added to their calendar.
Finally, users will be able to create their own unique types of parties (horror-movie theme, or American fromagerie theme!)
